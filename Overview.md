## CuerdOS its a Linux Distro based on Debian

### I'm one of the members of the team and this repo its intended to be a litle patch to meanwhile 

My motherboard refuses to boot whatever debian distro you put on them, the arch ones boots perfectly. 

In one of my tries to know why its causing this issue I made one custom kernel booting with a live and then it works.

The pc boots without issues.
